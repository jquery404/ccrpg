The Community Currency Role Play Game
*International XR Workshop 2021 demo*

“The Community Currency Role Play”, which is currently played in two
rounds using pen and paper. The objectives of the game are to create awareness of money
flows in a community and how a special type of money, community currency, operates. The
game facilitators would like the game to be played in a digital format that allows players to
buy, sell and lend money to each other, that automates any calculations, visualises the flow
of money between roles, that visualises the status of each role, and allows remote players
to participate in the game.
